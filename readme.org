#+TITLE: mu4e-conversation

This package offers an alternate view to [[https://github.com/djcb/mu][mu4e]] e-mail display.  It shows all
e-mails of a thread in a single view, where each correspondant has their own
face.  Threads can be displayed linearly (in which case e-mails are displayed
in chronological order) or as an Org document where the node tree maps the
thread tree.
